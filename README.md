# ECE303: Embedded Systems & Interfacing

This folder contains selected projects from **ECE303: Embedded Systems & Interfacing** at Drexel University. The work focuses on sensor integration, real-time data communication, and wireless system control using the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Projects

- **Arduino Sensor Monitoring and Control System**  
  A real-time interface built using an Arduino, GY-87 IMU, ultrasonic sensor, and Node-RED. Users can monitor live sensor data (temperature, motion, distance) and control onboard LEDs from a browser-based dashboard via serial communication.

- **Wireless Sensor Control System (Station Mode Upgrade)**  
  An advanced version of the system using Station Mode on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. This setup allows wireless dashboard access from a mobile device over Wi-Fi and supports closed-loop control between Node-RED, Arduino, and a Python client.

Each project includes full code, documentation, and its own `README.md`.  
These projects demonstrate real-world embedded system design and two-way hardware-software integration.
